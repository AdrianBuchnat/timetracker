# TimeTracker Web App ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

This project was done in October, so it isn't the newest one. I just revealed it to the public. Although the API key might not work, the JS code is 100% written by me.

## Description

TimeTracker is a simple interactive time tracking tool that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks and their phases. The application is built on the Fetch API in JavaScript, enabling efficient communication with the server.

## Features

### 1. Adding New Tasks

Users can add new tasks by specifying their name and adding a brief description.

### 2. Adding Phases to Tasks

Different phases can be added to each task. Each phase has its description and time.

### 3. Deleting Tasks and Phases

Users have the ability to delete unnecessary tasks and phases, helping to maintain order in the application.
